{{<admonition type=note title="Medium">}}
"Interview Review" is a blog post series dedicated to reflecting on the questions I answered incorrectly during technical interviews. By thoroughly reviewing each question and answer, my aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the topics and scenarios involved. It serves as a means to avoid overestimating my own performance and prevent myself from making similar mistakes in the future.
